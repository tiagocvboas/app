# Simple sample app showing restfull api using spring boot and a couple of abstractions

It allows the CRUD operation of companies and owners. And allows the company to add multiple owners all through a rest api.



Application is currently deployed [here](http://obscure-plains-83225.herokuapp.com/)
It includes a simple index.html with a link to the API documentation

## Documentation

Added swagger Documentation to the project [here](http://obscure-plains-83225.herokuapp.com/docs/index.html) and [here](http://obscure-plains-83225.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html)

Since for some time the embedded version of the swagger-ui wasn't working so 
I've added it as static content and fixed the url to point to the root of the api 
which is running [here](http://obscure-plains-83225.herokuapp.com/api)
